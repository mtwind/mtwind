## Hello there

My name is Matthew Wind and I am an aspiring software developer graduating from Purdue University in 2026.

I am proficient in various languages and hope to gain more experience through full stack development before entering the industry full time.

I am particularly interested in the finance industry and algorithmic trading as I enjoy a fast paced environment. 

Outside of SWE, here are some things I enjoy:
- Soccer (Chelsea FC ðŸ’™)
- Traveling
- Skiing
- Hiking
- Poker and other card games
- Board games

Feel free to reach out to me anytime @ mtwind2003@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewtwind/
